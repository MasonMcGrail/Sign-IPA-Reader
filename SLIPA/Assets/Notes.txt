The following font is for text written in the transcription.
It covers all relevant symbols fairly well except for accented ⟨ɨ⟩.

    A number of settings can be specified in the material for the font,
    then saved as a new font to be applied elsewhere

At the end of the project, you can change the asset icons more systematically

Allowing specification of dominant/non-dominant doesn't work well with cardinal
directions, and it probably should be removed


To Do

* Visual change to symbol buttons when clicked / hovered over
* Highlight the buttons that are not ASCII
* There are no symbols for wiggling or any other kind of secondary articulation
* The bent and so on handshapes are not currently configured correctly
* Copy button text to clipboard

To Do Much Later
* The whole situation with fingers crossed and otherwise touching each other
  is currently too much to deal with
* Localizing it to Japanese and other languages would be ideal


* Dictionary

  * Needed Features
    * Load dictionaries for particular languages, such as ASL or JSL

  * Future Features
    * Users can make their own dictionaries
    * Words can be added to and deleted from dictionaries
    * Dictionaries can be exported and loaded as their files, possibly JSON files


Tests

* WATCH would be good to demonstrate

Immediate to-do

* Add hints for certain motions, as the elbows right now are fucked up
* Settings tab could be a help tab
* The directions need to be represented with two letters
* Display points for the places
* Possibly add more IK constraints
* Document Handshape
* Add check to make replaying an animation more efficient (same input or not)
* Would be good to use raycasting for relative left/right of the body
