The following font is for text written in the transcription.
It covers all relevant symbols fairly well except for accented ⟨ɨ⟩.

    A number of settings can be specified in the material for the font,
    then saved as a new font to be applied elsewhere

At the end of the project, you can change the asset icons more systematically

Allowing specification of dominant/non-dominant doesn't work well with cardinal
directions, and it probably should be removed


To Do Much Later
* The whole situation with fingers crossed and otherwise touching each other
  is currently too much to deal with
* Localizing it to Japanese and other languages would be ideal. Some preliminary examples:

    input assistance		入力支援
    settings				設定
    dictionary			    辞書
    info					情報
    "Hover over a letter to see its description;
    click on it to copy it to your clipboard."
    「特定の文字の説明を表示するには、カーソルを置きます
    その文字をクリックするとクリップボードにコピーします。」
    major places			主要な部位
    minor places			他の部位
    major movement		    主要な動き
    rotational movement	    回転の動き*
    accents				    区別符号*
    import dictionary		辞書をインポート
    export dictionary		辞書をエクスポート

    "This is a tool for visually producing Sign IPA notation."
    「これは視覚的に手話国際音声記号の表記を生産するツールです。」
    "It makes it easy to understand how signs are produced based on their
    phonetic spelling without having to look up each character in the Sign IPA documentation."
    「それぞれの文字を手話国際音声記号のドキュメントに調べることなく、
    発音記号から入力はどうやって行われるかわかりやすくなります。」


* Dictionary

  * Needed Features
    * Load dictionaries for particular languages, such as ASL or JSL

  * Future Features
    * Users can make their own dictionaries
    * Words can be added to and deleted from dictionaries
    * Dictionaries can be exported and loaded as their files, possibly JSON files


Notes

* 今アと中狭は違う

Immediate to-do

* Visual change to symbol buttons when clicked / hovered over
* Highlight the buttons that are not ASCII
* There are no symbols for wiggling or any other kind of secondary articulation
* The bent and so on handshapes are not currently configured correctly
* Add hints for certain motions, as the elbows right now are very off
* The directions need to be represented with two letters
* Display points for the places
* Possibly add more IK constraints
* Would be good to use raycasting for relative left/right of the body
* Might need to use schwa for movement between two places
* Add visualization of what the symbols represent
* The back doesn't bend to reach certain points
* Give better feedback for when the input for a place is mostly good, but not all
  mandatory symbols for that place have been supplied
